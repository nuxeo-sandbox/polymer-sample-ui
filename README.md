# Polymer App - Sample Implementation with REST API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

This template is a starting point for building apps using the Polymer 1.0 Starter Kit drawer-based
layout and the Nuxeo REST API. 

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.
